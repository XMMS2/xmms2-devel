Version 0.9.1 DrPong (2022-05-02)

11 years since the previous xmms2 release. The git history has
accumulated over 600 commits.

Notable changes:

* Bundled waf was updated to version 2.0.22. It now requires python3.

* The ffmpeg plugin was updated to support upstream API changes.

* The medialib database backend switched from sqlite3 to s4, which was
  created specifically for xmms2.

  For typical xmms2 setups that run in home directories, the medialib
  migration will happen automatically: once the new version of `xmms2d`
  starts, it will convert the ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.db sqlite
  database to the ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.s4 s4 database by running the
  `sqlite2s4` tool.

  In daemon logs you should be able to find messages similar to the
  following:

    20:49:30  INFO ... Attempting to migrate database to new format
    20:46:30  INFO ... Migration successful.

  Conversion takes a while. While it happens, most operations on the
  medialib are blocked. For an example library of 30000 entries (~78MB
  medialib.db), it took 8 minutes to migrate to s4 on SSD. The
  conversion uses fsync() calls extensively and might take longer on
  HDD.

  Once the conversion is done, the sqlite database will move to
  ~/.config/xmms2/medialib.db.obsolete.

* The new `sqlite2s4` tool was added. `xmms2d` expects its presence in
  `PATH` to perform automatic medialib conversion to the s4 format.
